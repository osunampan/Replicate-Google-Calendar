## Initialization: 
1. created a github project.

3. used angular framework.
4. pulled latest changes back to repo.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
1. once the code is deployed you will be able to see play around the funcitonality.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## NPM Library Used

Moment and fullcalender were used.
NOTE: fullcalender is the old version 3.6.0. The latest fullcalender is divided into diff components. so i have avoided now for simplicity.
